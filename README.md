## Testing
- I will be testing throughout using dev tools in Google Chrome. This will allow me to ensure that my webpage is responsive from a mobile first perspective.

## Deployment
- Deployed early to ensure basic navbar appears correctly on page. This will allow for automatic deployments with each git push made to the repository.

## future
- Potential to add or remove images from carousel.
- Update/change carousel headings and paragraphs as necessary. Image captions are overlapping
- Removed some captions to prevent overlap until a fix can be arranged.
- Repair carousel button so that users can cycle through the images if desired.
